# Kiria: Dotfile Repository and Theme Switcher
(maybe this should've been called DoRTS)

Created by Lucina Paige and the Shibuya System, 2020

Documentation so far:
* Every subdirectory is a theme and is directly representative of the home directory, i.e. $CONF_DIR/Reincarnation/* is translated to ~/*
* Any subdirectory prefixed with "P_" (e.g. $CONF_DIR/P_Reincarnation) is patch-based and requires the kiria script to be run to swap themes
